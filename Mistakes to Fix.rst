Mistakes to Fix
===============

Done
----

- Put commas inside quotation marks in list of original publications
- Edits written in from reading in Nov
- Review forward: should it say "lightly editted" or something?
- Update revision date at end
- Replaced ``â€™`` with ``'``.
  This fixes missing apostrophe in "You werent well liked"
  in *Oh Little Quick Forgetter Pt. 3*.

Won't Do
--------

- Any footnotes/postscripts? Footnote for "fancy dancer"?
- Add 3 poems sent to Spencer for "Praris Review"?
- Maybe add commas in titles of "Oh Little Quick Forgetter"
  like "Oh Little Quick Forgetter, Pt. 1"
