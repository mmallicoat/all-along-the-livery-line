Todo
----

- Update revision date at end
- Review forward: should it say "lightly editted" or something?
- Edits written in from reading in Nov
- Any footnotes/postscripts? Footnote for "fancy dancer"?
- Add 3 poems sent to Spencer for "Praris Review"?



Done
----

- Replaced ``â€™`` with ``'``.
  This fixes missing apostrophe in "You werent well liked"
  in *Oh Little Quick Forgetter Pt. 3*.
