# Todo

* I think I do what to list which poems come from which
* Final review of preface


# Done
* Finalize order of poems in book
* Finalize order of publications in citations
* Figure out how to style the citations: look at style guides for help
* Finalize title
* Proof poems: fix em dashes, add italics
* Finalize overall formatting, including title page

# Errors

"Underfull hbox" error means there are lines too short for Latex to full justify. This is caused by almost every poem, which is unsurprising. I don't think this necessarily needs to be fixed.
